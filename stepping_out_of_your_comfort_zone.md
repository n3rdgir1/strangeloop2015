## Learners
* visual spacial: 
	* think in pictures, intuition, artistic/mechanical/technical, perfectionists
	* Implement: moar pictures!
* aural:
	* pitch and rhythm, natural musicians, notice the background music
	* What about using music in your presentation (like in Kevin's D&D campaign)
	* implement: sound recordings
* Verbal-linguistic
	* traditional teaching, can write and speak well, tongue twisters, know the meanings of words
	* implement: roleplaying in a group, active discussions, listen to recordings or physically write out notes, like learning new languages, self talk (saying things out loud to yourself)
* Physical-kinesthetic
	* talk with your hands, hands on activities, lots of energy and need to move
	* implement: focus on sensations, show and tell, role playing, doing not reading
* Logical-mathmatical
	* logic puzzles, need to know why/how behind the scenes, strong visual skills and arive at answer not knowing why
	* implement: progress through system, don't jump around, diagrams
* Solitary/Social
	* how they function better at learning: working alone or in groups
	
Have multiple styles, but some are stronger than others. Your learning styles whill influence how you speak "I see what you mean" versus "I hear your point".

## Adult learners
* peer relationship with instructors
* greater availability with instructors
* link new learning to prior learning
* evaluate the information that fits with experiences
* needs to be applicable to actually learn, no more theories

Motivation

* wants and needs
* benefiting social relations
* perceptions of "being an adult" (keeping job, staying current)
* improvement
* escape/stimulation: new experiences
* going down rabbit hole, clicking all the wiki annotation links

* like progression towards goal
* like rewards or getting benefits of learning

How to remember what is taught?

* reinforcement
	* positive (raise, free food, praise)
	* negative (lack of positive reinforcement)
* retention
	* practice!
	* see the meaning
	* see purpose
	* interpret the stuff
	* be able to apply it
* transference
	* use learned stuff in new situation
	* using stuff soon
	* importance of needing it Now
	
## Presentations with learners in mind

There is a learning pyramid for average student retention rates:

* Lecture: does not give a percentage
* Reading: 10%
* Audiovisual: 20%
* Demonstration: 30%
* Discussion: 50%
* Practice doing: 75%
* Teaching others: 90%

Tips:

* makes slides available
* let people record
* evaluate your content
	* make sure it's clearly represented
	* cover multiple learning styles
	* how is it better: picture, graph, discussion?
* relevance
	* need to know why this is important
* attention
	* everyone loses focus occasionally
	* change grabs attention
	* make small/big changes (font, picture)
	* macro changes
		* movement, teaching style, teacher, delivery method, visual mediums
		* don't be afraid of silence: silence gets people to refocus to the presenter
	* micro changes
		* visual sections, brain break, pauses, manurisms, jokes appropriate for the audience, stories
